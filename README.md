## Overview
Hey there. 
So this is my attempt on this Frontend-mentor challenge.
I would say any of my three versions are not that bad if the screen is draged to full size.

However inbetween my breaking points if i drag the window strange things things happen to my
tamplate. It´s just not moving correctly. I would apreciated if someone could tell me what i did
wrong with my breakpoints or if my browser is just the problem.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
